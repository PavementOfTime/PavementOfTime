- Hello! I'm Luke.
- I usually have the username of PavementOfTime, sometimes TimePavement if I can snatch that, or LukeTheNuke1111 if all else fails.
- I am interested in Software Development, Web Development, and honestly general CS.
- I know Java primarily, but have been learning some C++ and Rust. :3
